# Tic-Tack-Toe-with-AI
Hello everyone,

The project is an AI based tick tac toe game developed in Matlab.
Clone the project and look for a file called as "mainController.m", this file is main file from where the game will start.
Human player will move first and the AI's will move afterwards.
There are two images other than the matlab files. One of them is "tick.png" and the other one is "cross.png". These are the symbols used represent player 1 (human) and player 2 (AI) on the board.
Feel free to ask anything related to the files or the code.
